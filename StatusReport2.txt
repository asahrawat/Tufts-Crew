David Knopov Update #1:

(1) This week I worked on setting up the google calendar API for Practice Schedules.
I added all the practices, and races from the tufts team crew schedule. I also added a 
spreadsheet for players to log in their workouts. 


(2)
One issue I faced is figuring out how to best include the google spreadsheet of all the google calendars.
I decided to include a link at the top of the practice schedule.

(3) My goal for next week is to finish up making the calendar and spreadsheet look nice, and then tackle another
problem such as Lactate or Randomizer ( Depending on my discussion with the team next week.)
