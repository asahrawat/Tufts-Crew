David Knopov, Chadd Yuan Update #1:

(1) This week I worked on setting up the google calendar API for Practice Schedules.
I added all the practices, and races from the tufts team crew schedule. I also added a 
spreadsheet for players to log in their workouts. I, Chadd, worked on the preliminary
steps of implementing the announcemets section for the team feed page. 


(2)
One issue I faced is figuring out how to best include the google spreadsheet of all the google calendars.
I decided to include a link at the top of the practice schedule.
Another issue we faced on the team feed page was how to design/ implement the announcements section
to allow onyl certain people to post and have it always show up when other people go to the page

(3) My goal for next week is to finish up making the calendar and spreadsheet look nice, and then tackle
another problem such as Lactate or Randomizer ( Depending on my discussion with the team next week.)
My (chadd) goal for next week is to figure out how to properly set up a true announcements section
perhaps using the server knowledge we just gained.
