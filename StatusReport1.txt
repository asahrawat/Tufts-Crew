Status Check-up #1:





David Knopov Update #1:

(1) This week I worked on setting up the google calendar API for Practice Schedules.
I managed to get a blank calendar on to the Practice_Schedule.html.


(2)
One issue I faced is figuring out how to obtain this google calendar and how to present it
in the best way possible. Another one was a way to organize our website so that it would be
user-friendly

(3) My goal for next week is to add events and create the Race_Schedule google calendar as well.
	An Ambitious goal would be to find a way to attach a google spreadsheet that will log all
	the athletes workouts for each practice.

Chadd Yuan Update #1:

(1) This week I worked on implementing the twitter API and setting up the 
team_feed page. I currently have succesfuly implemented a Tufts Crew twitter
feed that displays the latest posts.

(2) Luckily, I did not face too many issues as the twitter API was well docuemnted. I did
try and implement a instagram API, but struggled as the instragram API had a lot of 
restrictions and thus had to switch to twitter.

(3) My goals for next week is to have the news feed page finished by implementing the 
public news functionality and an anouncements section that somehow (not decided yet) 
allows certain or all team members to post in a input box some announcement to be
shared with everyone else.
